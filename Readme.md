# Overview
The following is the study guide for the midterm.  It includes everything that we are expected to know for the test(s).
This project implements almost 100% of the key concepts covered.  I created this as a way to prepare for the midterm
and use the concepts in practice.

# Running the code
After you have checked out this project run
```
make run
```
